But, having started to actively use <a href="http://stillavinsergei.livejournal.com/">my blog</a> , I ran into a “network of evil”. <br><br>  As Sergei told in a telephone interview, he found out about the existence of LiveJournal back in 2006: radio listeners often began to ask questions if he had a blog in LiveJournal.  By his own admission, "these two letters" immediately caused him an allergy: Sergey is not a fan of mass phenomena (by the way, that is why he still has not watched the movie "Titanic").  However, on a rainy August evening in 2006, he still decided to create a LiveJournal blog: there was nothing to do that day anyway. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The first post, as often happens, did not cause a stir: PR did not conduct PR of his “live journal”.  Then for some time he left this occupation and resumed "writing" only in October.  He used the break to find out how to increase the readability of his journal.

      The number of readers began to grow after the so-called “provocative” topics: Sergei has been working for the media field for the first year and is able to submit interesting material.  He himself believes that it is interesting to read it for three reasons: the ease of the language, vitality (he writes often about the simplest things) and the already mentioned provocation.  However, the growth in the number of readers attracted the attention of traditional LJ floods, which dirtied comments to several posts last week. <br><br>  Sergey says that his father at one time was engaged in catching hooligans who opened the voice mailboxes of cellular subscribers.  Most often these were 15-year-olds, who "had only a computer and a sofa in the apartment."  Instead of going to discos, they, covered with acne with anger, sat and crap others with the help of a computer.  Sergey treats today's flooders in approximately the same way: “There are, of course, problem people - for example, hackers.  But there are worthless people who do not know how, except how to litter LJ.  I do not understand their buzz. " <br><br>  Sergey chose a simple way to deal with such “worthless”: at the moment when he is not at the computer, he turns on the automatic hiding of comments from people whom he didn’t “zafrendil”;  as a result, it becomes meaningless to make a flame in the comments on posts.  However, Sergey Stillavin spends a lot of time at the computer, so most often this mode is disabled - and he is happy to respond to normal comments and “bans” flooders, occasionally posting their IP addresses for general viewing.  The law, according to which providers do not have the right to “get into computers to subscribers,” should be corrected, he said: “you need to document who is sitting at the computer.” <br><br>  He does not intend to act according to the “method of Alksnis”, but he respects the deputy who has become so famous in the network: “He is a hero, there are more such people.  I myself am a man of patriotic views. ” <br><br>  Sergey Stillavin does not use other network services: “First of all I am a newsman and I read news resources”.  Sergey came to LJ because he was interested in understanding people: “Unfortunately, the conclusions were not the most comforting.” </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/6339/</p>
