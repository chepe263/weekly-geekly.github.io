  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex and Mail.ru. The war has begun?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many have probably already heard about Mail.ru's remarkable policy in the implementation of its software, in particular, the remarkable ‚Äúcode quotation‚Äù by Guard@Mail.Ru, which many should have already encountered personally.  In particular, this has already been repeatedly written on Habr√© ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139280/">tynts</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149636/">tynts</a> ).  Moreover, attention was paid not only to the actual effect of the software on the victim's computer, but also to particularly cynical methods of its distribution.  For those who are not particularly aware of the full picture, I‚Äôll explain that the situation has reached such a level that Mail.ru software has started to be bundled with completely third-party programs and people and companies not connected with them.  And all thanks to dubious sites that I personally would not even visit (but this does not mean that others ‚Äî less savvy users) didn‚Äôt go to them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Even then, quite logical questions began to sound: what about one of Mail.ru‚Äôs main competitors, Yandex, thinks about this?  After all, such a policy is directly related to it (however, Yandex itself is not without sin in this regard, but this is a completely different story).  And now it became clear: Yandex thought all this time, thought, thought, thought ... And then took, and <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/top/2012/11/08/yandeks_trebuet_s_predprinimatelya_million_za_posyagatelstvo_na_punto_switcher_509080">sued</a> one of the software sites involved in embedding special installers in other people's programs. <br><br>  <i>Yandex has filed a lawsuit with Yevgeny Balabanov, an individual entrepreneur from the Sverdlovsk Region.</i>  <i>In it, the search engine requires that Balabanov be banned from using the Punto Switcher program by distributing it along with other programs, prohibiting reproducing it and communicating to the public with changes in copyright information, and collecting 1 million rubles from the defendant.</i> 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      For those who are too lazy to read the entire article on the link, I will explain: this is about the site Skan.ru, which, in previous reviews of flights to the Habr√©, if I am not mistaken, has already got on the nuts.  The resource is generally not very top-notch and does not stand out with anything special if you don‚Äôt take into account one thing: it‚Äôs Mail.ru‚Äôs partner (of course, it‚Äôs impossible to trace the legal connection here, but in fact it‚Äôs on face).  And this particular site was the typical distributor of Mail.ru software. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIn this particular case, along with Punto Switcher, the user was asked to install the Sputnik @ Mail.ru program,‚Äù they say in Yandex.</i>  <i>‚ÄúWe believe that Skan.ru violated our rights by distributing the program, of which we are the copyright holder, in the same package as third-party programs without Yandex‚Äôs consent and in violation of the license conditions.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Well, the war has begun.  Officials will, of course, keep silent, lawyers will necessarily come up with a good wording, from which it will become clear that Mr. Balabanov himself is an evil cheburashka and acted solely out of his malicious motives, but we know that the most delicious is still to come. <br><br>  PS Link to the mail.ru blog in the quote I specified, automatically processed by Habr from the name of their product in this light looks particularly cynical. <br><br>  <b>UDPATE:</b> I decided to add an article to more accurately describe its meaning.  Of course, in this particular case there is no direct conflict.  And only on the basis of this event, a Yandex suit against Mail.ru should not be expected.  But the very fact of conflict of interest between affiliate programs (after all, Yandex has similar developments) is quite interesting. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/157983/</p>
