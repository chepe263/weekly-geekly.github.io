  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Software self motivation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are a lot of solutions for managing projects: paid, free, Internet, intranets are just local applications.  For example, from time to time we use <a href="http://teamer.ru/">teamer</a> (om) - a good thing, but it‚Äôs not like everyone else.  We omit all aspects of usability, functionality, cost, etc., I do not like the principle that underlies any similar program. <br><br>  Usually, the unit of meaning in such programs is the ‚Äúproject‚Äù, in it the manager creates a working group, defines tasks and deadlines, which, as a rule, are never maintained.  All this is well understood, but continue to use clenched teeth :).  Even if the project suddenly surrenders on time, this is not at all the merit of the program, but the result of the work of an intelligent manager. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Perhaps many will disagree with me, but the use of such ‚Äúautomation‚Äù rarely makes working on a project more efficient ... but makes life and psychological climate very great for everyone involved in the process, especially for the responsible group: managers, art director and leading programmers.  Because what you have already read, received, made, sent, agreed, sent, paid, you need to reflect, unsubscribe, comment in the "project".  And the only person who does the rest of the work :) is depressed with incessant notifications, timer reminders and a monthly plan.

      All these sad thoughts led to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãturning everything upside down.  And to implement the system, not so much for the organization, as for reflecting the usefulness and effectiveness of each member of the team and the company as a whole.  I will try to explain. <br><br>  During the day, for each person, the company collects data that are conventionally divided into ‚Äúuseful‚Äù and ‚Äúuseless‚Äù cases.  The sources of this data are also two.  This is directly the user himself, who writes down what he has done useful, and only need to write logically complete parts of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc3/c01/c2c/fc3c01c2c0967a1fcb073434fdc3ce23.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>All entries are made in any form.</i>  <i>If the project is large, you can divide it into logically complete fragments.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb5/cca/1f8/cb5cca1f814a1cb2a2c020ff4d0e320a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Collecting and sorting proxy server data is a much more difficult task, but also solvable.</i> <br><br>  And the data that will be recorded automatically based on the logs.  Why?  Because the Internet carries as much benefit as harm :) As a result, each user individually and the company as a whole by the end of the month have a complete picture of efficiency.  And while no one is annoying. <br><br>  We have a small company, our entire strong-willed team easily fits into one room.  And in general, all the clever people work without raising their heads, and the iron on the manager‚Äôs desk is always on, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing to do with it :) Therefore, we haven‚Äôt yet had an urgent need to write such a program on our own.  The pictures are taken from the dusty folder ‚Äúideas‚Äù in the deepest wilds of my hard drive. <br><br>  But maybe someone came across ready-made software working on this principle?  And how do you like this organization of work? </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/45708/</p>
