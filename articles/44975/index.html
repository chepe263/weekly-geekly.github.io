Meetings take place in different ways.  Well, the quantity allows you to think the selection of quality. <br><br>  He brought a couple of good recipes.  This is about how to do it.  For some reason, good advertising is done differently, but bad for the same inexplicable reasons - the same. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. As a guide, select advertising incomprehensible company in an unknown financial situation.  It should be a choice at the level of "well, well, I like there as a person talking on the phone."  Or "that's how cool the earth is." <br><br>  2. The design level should be ‚Äúlike a BMW car‚Äù.  Options "like a BMW logo."  Well, something like that, like this. 
      <br>
        <script>document.write('<script src="//pagea' + 'd2.googles' + 'yndication.com/pagea' + 'd/js/a' + 'dsby' + 'google.js"></script>')</script>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>

      3. Crap all the examples of advertising people who have achieved in your area more than you.  It is clear that they were just lucky with such a shitty and uncreative advertising to earn so much money. <br><br>  4. Often use the word "not like everyone else", "creative" and "original artistic decision." <br><br>  5. The best way to set the problem is ‚ÄúCho someday‚Äù.  Draw something cho.  Come up with something.  Quickly bring something, I want to look at creativity. <br><br>  6. Graduating art school 20 years ago allows you to roll your eyes confidently and click your tongue.  You can smile and shake your head.  After all, the sheet must be filled out completely, right? <br><br>  7. Knowledge of the psychology of color, underlined from glossy magazines - the cornerstone of any advertising. <br><br>  8. Your face is the face of your business!  It should be everywhere.  The customer is not a fool, he works with real people.  We must immediately show who you are and say hello to him! <br><br>  9. Real customers do everything themselves.  Designers are involved only to confirm this opinion. <br><br>  10. In general, after you get tired of everything, you‚Äôll be drawing cars at Toyota.  Such plans for life. <br><br>  11. The designer does not think.  Designer draws.  Draws, draws and draws. <br><br>  12. All elements of the advertising campaign should be as different as possible.  It surprises and attracts attention. <br><br>  13. Designers work on a portfolio of up to 40 years.  Remind them, show that you are aware of the real state of things. <br><br>  14. ‚ÄúChange name on business card‚Äù is an excellent reason to cheaply and quickly remake advertising products and brand book.  Anyway, the business card is different, right? <br><br>  15. Three things in the booklet definitely suit you: the globe, the coat of arms of Russia and the director's photo.  A 400% increase in sales is guaranteed. <br><br>  16. Designers usually miss.  Come, poke his finger into his monitor, help to draw.  Entertain the person. <br><br>  17. Designers work on batteries.  Do not hesitate, call him in three nights from the bath "as there our bukletik." <br><br>  18. Slogan without rhyme - shit.  As inanimate. <br><br>  19. Logic in accounting.  Sales - in sales.  In advertising - creativity and spiritual enthusiasm.  Do not think about anything, give your all to secret desires. <br><br>  20. Photography, copywriting, corporate identity - for suckers.  This advertiser will make candy and without all this. <br><br>  21. Booklet is needed in order to distribute and forget.  In general, all distribute and forget.  Hooley, mastered the advertising budget, and will be. <br><br>  22. Your child is definitely better at drawing. <br><br>  23. Corporate site for a shoe store - this is normal. <br><br>  Drink kefir at night, be happy. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/44975/</p>
