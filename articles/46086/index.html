      After reading the interesting arguments presented by the author of this article, and agreeing in some ways, and disputing them in some ways, I decided to use the same technique as in the series of my last notes about <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D127123">cloud computing</a> .  Again, I‚Äôll start by <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D127652">translating the</a> main section of the article, in which the author asks: ‚ÄúWhy won't Enterprise 2.0 work?‚Äù And answers the question himself.  And then from my point of view, but in another note, I will try to answer this question myself.  In Habr√©, as in the case of the ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pure_content/45583">clouds,</a> ‚Äù I will present only the final conclusions of each of the participants in this correspondence exchange of views. <br><br>  I cited the conclusions of the author of the translated article at the beginning of this note.  My conclusions are still coming.  In the meantime, a few words about his rather mysterious virtual "interlocutor."  I was never able to reveal the true name.  Everything he writes hides under the ‚Äúnickname‚Äù Drama 2.0.  It was only possible to find out that this famous, but mysterious stranger is a member of the <a href="http://www.e-consultancy.com/">e-consultancy</a> club of full-time bloggers, where he is also represented as the Chief Expert (Chief Connoisseur) from Uruguay :).  After in 2006 this General Expert posted a critical comment on a single note at TechCrunch and referred to this comment at the San Francisco Chronicle, he was offered a contract worth $ 5 million. Under this agreement, he maintains his own blog, similarly to television. called " <a href="http://www.drama20show.com/">The Drama 2.0 Show</a> ". <br><br>  I think that what has been said about the author of the translated article should interest the reader, and at least in order to learn how to prepare the content in order to earn a million in just one comment, he will run through the <a href="http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/366640/a-look-at-enterprise-2-0.html">original.</a> <br><br>  <i>Well, for those who want to participate in the correspondence conversation about why, in fact, Enterprise 2.0 is not working as it would be desirable for its apologists, I offer my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D127652">translation</a> in iTech Bridge.</i> </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/46086/</p>
