  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer addiction does not exist</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An unexpected continuation of the topic of <a href="http://al13.habrahabr.ru/blog/45025/">computer addiction</a> .  It turns out that computer game lovers are absolutely normal people.  To date, all the allegations of the harmfulness of cruel games were based only on speculation - no reliable and reliable medical tests have been conducted. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  For the first time, the founder and head of the Smith &amp; Jones Center clinic, Keith Bakker, specializing in helping gamers affected by their hobbies, began to seriously study the impact of computer games on the psyche of teenagers.  Since its foundation in 2006, the clinic has taken several hundred young patients, so that during this time the organization has managed to accumulate a significant amount of statistical data and experience in the detection / treatment of mental disorders. <br><br>  Despite the fact that some of the gamers really need medical assistance for the treatment of "computer" addiction and related problems, their number does not exceed 10% of the total number of gamers.  The remaining 90% of fans of virtual battles, even spending more than four hours a day at the computer, are absolutely normal from the point of view of psychiatrists individuals. <br><br>  However, the remaining 10% of potential patients in medical institutions also do not have serious mental deviations - in this case, there are certain problems of social adaptation, which, however, can be easily solved.  The experience of the Smith &amp; Jones Center clinic has shown that providing their patients with the possibility of normal communication, when they really listen to their opinion, and not ignore, fully returns the ‚Äúsick‚Äù to a normal state.  As Kate Bakker states, the main blame for the problems of young gamers should not be placed on computer game developers, and certainly not on the adolescents themselves, but on their parents who are not adequately fulfilling their responsibilities for raising their children.

      <br>
      As for cruelty, which teenagers allegedly learn by spending hours at their favorite computer games, the situation here is also not as dire as it seems at first glance.  The same Kate Bakker notes that initially violent teenagers (not the least reason for which is insufficient education) choose more violent computer games.  Thus, it is necessary to swap the cause and effect, and it is quite possible to gain benefit from the games by highlighting the especially cruel gamers in advance and paying them more attention.  Of course, parents should do this, not the game industry, which is blamed for all sins. <br><br>  Summing up, it is worth noting the following: speaking of the negative impact of computer games on the health of a teenager, his parents are trying to shift all the responsibility from their shoulders to the developers.  If the child‚Äôs behavior deviates from the norm, then the people who care about him should notice this first and take appropriate measures to prevent more serious consequences.  No one, except parents, is able to educate young gamers. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/45580/</p>
