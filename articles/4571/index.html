The reasons for this discontent are difficult to judge.  Most likely, the reasons are mainly subjective.  After all, it has long been known that changing the owner of a mass service is almost always painfully perceived by users of this service.  Exactly the same situation was after the purchase of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr by</a> <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> , after the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/article/410/">change of leadership of the portal Netscape</a> , as well as after the recent <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1097/">sale of YouTube</a> .

      Users obviously have a vague feeling that they were ‚Äúsold‚Äù.  In fact, the way it is.  Buying the ‚ÄúRussian part of LJ‚Äù, the company ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù buys not so much technology and content, but first of all - access to the subscriber base.  Perhaps this is the largest transaction for the sale of "live goods" in the history of the Russian Internet. <br><br>  It is necessary to fight against the natural negative reaction of users due to competent PR.  In our case, PR, in fact, was absent: ‚ÄúI believe that the public position of the project leaders and the people responsible for PR at Sup was incoherent, undeveloped, and over time became aggressive and inappropriate,‚Äù the publishing general director <a href="http://artbelousov.ru/%3Fp%3D30">writes in her diary</a> home "Kommersant" Demian Kudryavtsev.  - I think they were not ready either to the level of public interest, or to the subject of emerging issues ... We must judge by deeds, not by words.  Worth giving ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù a try.  If they fail, or their innovations spoil the system, well, then - the world is full of other blog services, and everyone who wants to change the site will find a place for themselves.  Maybe even more convenient.  RSS will allow readers to aggregate posts from different blogs in one feed.  So I do not see any problem of personal choice.  Mass agitation, calls for ‚Äúexodus,‚Äù conspiracy - this all seems meaningless and bad to me. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the meantime, ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù and personally Anton Nosik became targets for the real ‚Äúcompany of hatred‚Äù, which is now gaining momentum.  Perhaps the biggest mistake of Anton was that he allowed himself to <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/806177.html%3Fthread%3D22104353">call</a> his ideological enemies and opponents with the contemptuous word ‚Äúbastards‚Äù.  Opponents immediately distorted his words as if Anton Nosik was talking about all the users of Livejournal.  The web even appeared relevant banners (see <a href="">screenshot</a> ). <br><br>  How this story will end is still unknown, but every day the situation seems to be gradually getting out of control of the Soup PR service. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/4571/</p>
