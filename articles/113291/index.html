The fact is that every Spaniard may, according to the law of his country, demand the removal of any personal data that spoils a person‚Äôs reputation, or simply this person does not like.  For example, someone simply does not want information about him / her to "shine" on the web.  By law, any Spaniard may require that such information be deleted, and the owner of the site (the Spanish) will be obliged to delete such information.  So, the state agency for the protection of private information in Spain is now engaged in the consideration of complaints by Spaniards who do not want this or other information about them to appear in the results of Google search results. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  By law, the same government agency for the protection of private information deals with requests for the removal of personal data of disgruntled Spaniards.  Earlier, representatives of the Spanish authorities filed a formal request to the leadership of Google, but the corporation refused to delete information, arguing that the corporation does not censor its search results.  After that, the Spanish authorities filed a complaint against Google in the Spanish court, demanding that the company, working in Spain, comply with Spanish laws.  It is remembered, by the way, that the Chinese, who censor a lot of things, applied to the leadership of Google with approximately the same wording.  Then there was a moment when it seemed that Google would leave China altogether, but everything ended up more or less safely.

      Now a similar situation has arisen in Spain, and it is not very clear how seriously the authorities of this country are ready to defend their opinion.  ‚ÄúPerhaps Google is hard to understand.  But there are different cultures in the world.  We are very concerned about our own security and the safety of personal data.  Google works in the Spanish segment of the Network, in the domain zone .ES, so the company must follow the law of our country, ‚Äùcommented Paloma Llanes, a lawyer of the prosecution.  Llanesa also noted that such situations are inevitable for large IT companies, including Google. <br><br>  So far, the management of the corporation is firmly on its own, refusing to censor search results, considering that the owners of web resources, where all this is located, should be the ones to remove the information specified in the lawsuit, and not Google, which only provides links to the source. <br><br>  By the way, in Germany there was also a similar problem when many Germans did not like the presence of their houses in the photos of the Google Street View service.  True, in this country the problem was solved quickly - Google created a special resource where the Germans could leave applications for the "glossing out" of their homes, which was done fairly quickly. <br><br>  It will be interesting to see how the Spanish problem is solved. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/In-Madrid-Court-Google-Challenges-Europes-Privacy-Laws-115012364.html">voanews</a> </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/113291/</p>
