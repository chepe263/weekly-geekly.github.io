  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Clouds" in enterprises: current trends</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article, we will present to your attention the results of recent studies related to the prevalence of ‚Äúclouds‚Äù in business, the forecast of cloud technologies for the next 5 years, and several interesting trends identified in the course of research. <br>  The ranks of conservatives who resist the introduction of cloud applications into the business are rapidly thinning.  According to recent studies, more than a third of end users believe that the cloud is the best way to store information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d0/688/df1/2d0688df1d04bdbdf380fa17032378fe.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The study ‚ÄúThe 2012 Future of Cloud‚Äù conducted by North Bridge Venture showed that the use of cloud computing for critical business processes is growing: the proportion of respondents who positively responded about the ‚Äúclouds‚Äù was actually 50%, but this figure included not only the final users, but also manufacturers, and, since most manufacturers are interested in promoting cloud computing, could be distorted.  According to last year's survey, in which North Bridge did not divide respondents into groups, only 13% of respondents were familiar with cloud technologies.

      ‚ÄúThis is significant progress for one year,‚Äù said Michael Skok, general partner of North Bridge.  As many as 57% of respondents identified a desire to achieve scalability as the main motivating factor for the use of "clouds". <br><br>  A few more interesting excerpts from the study: <br><ul><li>  Software such as Salesforce.com, today has the highest "cloud" investment attractiveness: 82% of respondents said they use SaaS today, and 88% - that they plan to start using within the next 5 years. </li><li>  The use of the Platform will also increase: if PaaS is currently used by 40% of enterprises, then in 5 years its prevalence should be 72%. </li><li>  The use of IaaS as a service should increase from 51% to 61%. </li><li>  55% of respondents still doubt the safety of ‚Äúclouds.‚Äù According to Skok, ‚ÄúConfidence in clouds among business users is growing steadily because companies have had enough time to move from testing and development to full-fledged production.‚Äù </li></ul><br><br><h5>  On the safety of "clouds" </h5><br><br>  Skok also admitted that insecurity in storing data in the cloud is quite common, but suggested that this problem, like all others, will be solved over time: ‚ÄúIn the late nineties, people generally said that they would never use their credit cards to buy goods through the Internet, so what? ". <br><br>  The results of other studies are not much different from the above.  About 25% of directors of IT enterprises surveyed by <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/data_centers/240001236">InformationWeek</a> stated that their company plans to use the public cloud in large projects this year, although now this figure is only 11%.  <a href="http://www.jdpower.com/content/press-release/2GkJJyH/2012-business-data-satisfaction-study.htm">The JD Power's 2012 Business Data Satisfaction Study</a> , published last month, showed that since last year, the share of enterprises using cloud services has increased from 12% to 18%. <br><br>  Speaking of doubts about the safety of the clouds.  "There are things that will never be transferred to the cloud, but companies will continue to use the clouds to save money on not the most critical computing and data storage at least in order to be able to invest more in their IT departments working on something really important, ‚Äùsays Joe Coyle, technical director of the North American branch of Capgemini. <br><br>  Skok also noted that the study revealed a trend towards the integration of some key technologies in the clouds.  North Bridge calls this ‚Äúcloud formations‚Äù. <br>  ‚Äú90% of respondents said that analytics is one of the main advantages of cloud technologies.  When everything is transferred to the clouds, every transaction and every click will suddenly become available for analysis.  Here is an example of cloud education, ‚Äùsays Skok.  Others point out the "merging" of e-commerce and payments, media and entertainment, and social cooperation. <br><br>  Thus, all studies show that in the near future almost every enterprise will start using ‚Äúclouds‚Äù. <br>  What do you think cloud technologies will be in 5 years? </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/147763/</p>
