  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human memory</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article, I will determine what requirements are placed on the Xmal project to improve human memory and the development of algorithmic abilities in humans.  We consider what types of memory exist, and what methods of improving memorization are used.  You will learn about 3 laws of memorization, short-term and long-term, visual and auditory memory and why we use only 10% of our memory abilities. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Memory</b> <br>  Memory is a unique property of man.  Without it, it is impossible to imagine his life.  Thanks to her, we can use the experience of previous generations and not make mistakes that have already been identified in the past. <br><br>  <b>What kinds of memory exist</b> <br>  Memory is long and short term. <br>  Consider the effect of these two types of examples: <br>  1. Short-term memory <br>  A student, the day before the exam, can push a huge amount of information into his memory, but soon <s>, or rather immediately after the exam,</s> he will forget what he learned, because information is formed in the short-term memory, which will then be placed in the long-term, which is very limited, and most of it disappears. <br>  2. Long-term memory <br>  Patients with the so-called senile forgetfulness in the smallest details remember the events that occurred in early childhood or many years ago, but are unable to keep in mind what was half an hour ago.

      <b>Visual and auditory memory</b> <br>  Some people remember better what they saw, some what they heard.  On this basis, the memory is divided into visual and auditory. <br>  <b>It is better to remember the subject of interest.</b> <br>  <b>The memory of feelings is very stable</b> <br><br>  <b>Do not confuse memory with absentmindedness!</b> <br>  Scattered faces are immersed in their thoughts, their attention is just concentrated, but on another object.  Household information is completely uninteresting to them. <br><br>  <b>How to improve memory?</b> <br>  Often, memory performance can be improved.  Vitamins C, E, B6, B12, beta-carotene, fatty acids contained in salmon, tuna, sardines, herring, extract from the ginkgo bilon plant help in this. <br><br>  <b>ten%</b> <br>  The average person uses no more than 10% of the innate capabilities of their memory.  And all because we can’t use the natural <b>laws of memorization</b> . <br><br>  <b>Laws of memorization</b> <br>  There are only 3 of them: <br>  1. Impression. <br>  2. Repetition. <br>  3. Association. <br><br>  <b>Stress will help</b> <br>  Have you ever been in stressful situations?  Surely any of you will say "Yes."  Try to recall this situation.  Despite how long ago it was, human memory remembers the stressful event quite clearly.  And it is difficult to forget this event. <br>  In a state of emotional elevation, things that seem to have long been forgotten are sometimes caused from memory. <br><br>  <b>Let's summarize and draw up requirements</b> <br>  According to a survey conducted yesterday, we can conclude that the maximum efficiency in a person is caused in silence.  But the slow music is also close by. <br>  What happens: <br>  <b>1. Allow the user to choose between missing or playing slow</b> <br>  <b>2. The material taught should be of interest to the user.</b> <br>  <b>3. Determine how a person remembers better by watching a lecture or listening to it and focus on this assessment.</b> <br>  <b>4. In each subsequent lecture should be the material of the previous one (the law of repetition)</b> <br>  <b>5. To teach the user to associate objects with objects of the world (the law of association)</b> <br>  <b>6. To arouse interest in material from scattered people.</b> <br>  <b>7. Develop user requirements for maximum results in the course of working with the program</b> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> In the preparation of the material was used the work of Vladimir Shcherbakov "Secrets of memory" <br></div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/45143/</p>
