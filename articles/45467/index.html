  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to promote your video on YouTube</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I get a lot of questions about how I managed to get into the list of YouTube users who are most subscribed to, and how I get so many views of my videos.  I was even a little bit overtaken by the fact that I overtook ParisHilton. <br><br>  First, let me convince you that it takes a lot of patience.  I hung out on YouTube for almost a year before I even got 100 subscribers, and for most of my videos it was good luck if they got 10-20 views.  Only on the last day of Thanksgiving, I was able to reach 200 subscribers (see video). <br><br>  In addition to being patient, there are a few things you can do.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Remember, this is a social network.</b>  Most viewed authors often become popular through interaction with other frequently viewed YouTube users.  Zipster08 began with jeers at Renetto.  Renetto has become popular by contacting other YouTube users.  So you need to be social on YouTube.  This is not just a site where videos are posted, this is a community. <br><br>  <b>Keep your videos short.</b>  We are dealing with the generation of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).  This is so ... so ... so important!  I recently broke my own rule, but I can't change the fact that people don‚Äôt want a video more than three minutes long.  And if you can cut it down to 30-60 seconds, you will get a doubling of views.  I often don‚Äôt even start playing videos that are longer than 5 minutes.  Just YouTube is not a platform for long videos.  Perhaps AppleTV will give us the opportunity to watch longer videos, but briefly means good. <br><br>  <b>Avoid tricks.</b>  You can fake the number of views and put random video responses to popular videos, but this usually makes you hopeless (if not a loser).  So stick to honest promotion. <br><br>  <b>Collaborate with YouTube users.</b>  Find other people from YouTube and make a video together.  So you get some of their subscribers, and vice versa.  Everybody wins. <br><br>  <b>Be "good."</b>  I am lucky that many of those who look at me are kind when setting ratings and comments.  Therefore, I often throws up (temporarily) in the top of the comic section.  There I‚Äôm catching a second wave of views for a while.  Since this is hard to do right away, for a start you can focus in less competitive headings.  It is much easier to make the most viewed video about little animals than a music video. <br><br>  <b>Promote your videos outside of YouTube.</b>  Add them to bookmarks and announcements services.  Add them to blogs.  Remember that a significant portion of the views does not necessarily occur on YouTube.com. <br><br>  <b>Video Responses.</b>  Video responses are a great way to get views.  Especially if you are fast.  Make a video response to a popular video and post it immediately.  Your view count is overwhelming.  Just be sure that: a) your answer is not spam, it is really important and b) remember that many people do not know that video responses are waiting for approval.  Therefore, they quietly lie to themselves and are not always quickly approved. <br><br>  <b>Imagine yourself at a party.</b>  Aren't you that guy jumping around, trying to get attention by shouting ‚ÄúLook at me‚Äù?  Or are you the one who walked away from the bar, telling interesting stories?  Or do you hopelessly strike for any oncoming beauty?  Step on YouTube as if you were participating in a party, and you better understand how you are perceived here.  These vibrations will accompany you not only in your videos, but also in interactions with people (comments and posts).  By the way, about me - I'm the guy at the party who drank too much, and then went to sleep in a bed with ties scattered around. <br><br>  <b>Post good content regularly.</b>  I think that the frequency of the appearance of my videos (it is almost every day) helps.  I know that I could make better quality videos if I planned them, but I don‚Äôt like to over-complicate videos.  It is much more interesting to be subscribed to someone who posts videos with a certain frequency (and at the same time they should be interesting), because you do not forget about them.  Think ahead to look after your subscribers. <br><br>  <b>Be prepared for hate.</b>  Do not forget - there are as many people who will hate your videos as you like them.  I get a lot of claims messages, and there are a number of people who subscribe and unsubscribe.  Ultimately, you build a group of people who somehow relate to you by properties.  And this is the moment when it becomes really interesting. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/45467/</p>
