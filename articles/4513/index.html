  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The founder of "MegaFon" asks for protection from the Russian minister</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The court of the Southern District of New York received a lawsuit from a US citizen of Russian origin Leonid Rozhetskin to the Minister of Information Technology and Communications of Russia Leonid Reiman.  Mr. Rozhetskin claims that, through the IPOC fund, Reiman is pursuing him for selling in 2003 a 25.1% stake in Megafon to Alfa Group.  ‚ÄúIllegally manipulating the Russian law enforcement system, Reiman several times sought to initiate a criminal case against Rozhetskin by the Moscow prosecutor‚Äôs office,‚Äù said his lawyers in a statement.  The claim is a ban on further prosecutions and accusations against Rozhetskin and payment of monetary compensation, the amount of which, however, is not called. <br><br>  It all began in 2001, when Reiman, "threatening Rozhetskin's life and freedom, forced him to sign an option to sell the blocking stake of MegaFon belonging to him to the Bermuda IPOC fund."  Rozhetskin described this fund as ‚Äúa money laundering machine created by Reiman‚Äù.  Two years later, not wanting to exercise the option, Rozhetskin sold his shares in Megafon to Alfa Group.  IPOC tried through court to force Alfa to exercise the option, but in May the International Arbitration Tribunal in Zurich rejected the fund‚Äôs claim, and ‚ÄúRozhetskin‚Äôs testimony played an important role in the court‚Äôs decision‚Äù. <br><br>  "Reiman makes false accusations against anyone who prevents them from establishing control over MegaFon, and Rozhetskin has become one of them," his lawyers believe.  In the "Alpha-group" reported that the filing of the claim Rozhetskin they do not know.  Jeffrey Galmond, a Dane who calls himself the owner of the IPOC foundation, on the contrary, knows that the actions of his foundation were the reason for filing a lawsuit against the Russian minister.  But, as Mr. Halmond reported to Habrahabru, he considers it more important that just a few days ago, Interpol declared Rozhetskina on the international wanted list just by the statement of the Moscow Prosecutor‚Äôs Office.

      The decision of the Zurich Tribunal is the main argument in the suit of Rozhetskin to Reiman.  Meanwhile, in his statement of claim to a US court, Mr. Rozhetskin did not mention that, having recognized Reiman as the owner of the IPOC fund, the tribunal at the same time rejected Rozhetskin‚Äôs arguments about the threats from the minister.  Then the judges considered that Rozhetskin had an ‚Äúelectoral memory‚Äù, since for some reason he remembers only a part of the events of the winter of 2001 (when, allegedly, threats were made against him).  In addition, the tribunal was surprised by the fact that, as an American citizen and a lawyer, Rozhetskin did not inform his lawyers about the resounding threats against him.  And Reiman himself said to the Russian media that ‚ÄúI am glad of the filing of a lawsuit to Rozhetskin, because the decision of the New York court will put an end to the flow of slander that he has been spreading over recent years.‚Äù </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/4513/</p>
