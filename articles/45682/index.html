To put it more precisely, it is not even a movement as such, it is standing in one place (and overgrown with moss).  And here we are in fact present one huge fraud of users with the aim of continuously pumping out of them funds. <br><br>  Naturally, many were surprised and raised an eyebrow, but think for yourself ... <br>  Two decades ago, we were already quite actively using computer equipment, right?  What did we do on it?  The same as now: played, wrote, thought ... <br>  In general, computers worked for themselves.  What has changed in these two decades?  (extremely rather long time given the ever-increasing speed of technology development) Yes, our computers have become faster thousands of times, the multimedia component has improved, the amount of stored data has increased in some astronomical numbers!  Moreover, the computer has become significantly more accessible (although there is something to argue about). <br><br>  But what have we lost?  We lost control of the PC and our own freedom! <br>  Yes it is!  We are no longer masters of their own equipment!  Moreover, the terrible future of the fantastic stories did not come.  We are not ruled by cars and terrible cyber reason does not send horrible robots with lasers and inflatable hammers to us clowns. <br>  We are at the mercy of the new elite - information corporations!  Terrible monsters that have long been solving non-applied tasks to create a database in which the search will occur in micronaneseconds.  No, that you are all the little things for students and small offices!  We solve more global issues. <br>  WE decide what you will use! <br>  We decide on what equipment! <br>  WE decide whether you will do your job or not! <br>  What?  You wonder, what actually remains for the user?  Of course, a free and democratic choice!  You can use our software on the equipment that we consider necessary, or you can be an outsider!  You have a choice!  No, well, of course, you can use (sly look) pirated software (yes, yes, it is also profitable for us! Get used to it, get used to our software and then, when we start shaking you, you have to buy it!) <br>  Someone is now trying to say about the existence of open source software, but in fact, behind it, there are ALREADY corporations standing up (often the same as behind closed ones) and they also solve all the same global issues ‚Äúhow to have a user‚Äù.

      So what is the way out?  The exit is always and everywhere!  We will have to postpone the options of the coming of Christ or the highly moral race of alien totalitarian;  and what remains?  there are two large families of solutions.  Change corporations (mde? Hmmm) and Change themselves.  I think the option with corporations disappears for obvious reasons;  It remains the option to change yourself - I remember someone else said, "if you want to change the world, start with yourself."  Here, too, there are two options: <br>  1. score all and go with the flow (not even discussed) <br>  2. Begin to CHOOSE what we use! <br><br>  And since this text is written by me, then, accordingly, without unnecessary disputes, choose the second option! <br>  After all, it is natural for us to choose a thing before buying it.  But for some reason we don‚Äôt even think about it at the mention of the software, and when it was called when the PROGRAM PRODUCT !!!  and then his people chose!  Evaluating the pros and cons, advantages and disadvantages!  and modern man must remember this!  and start to choose (thank God that there is still plenty to choose from ...) <br>  That is why the goal of our project is NOT to protect and promote (and other "advocacy") open, closed, paid, free or any other software.  The goal of our project is to REPORT the idea that WE are users and WE have to choose WHAT to use!  And we have to choose OUT OF QUALITY software, and not from a heap of shit devouring the place and memory of shit !!!  (and on the side of a bow ;-)) <br><br>  ¬© 2008 EFOlution.org </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/45682/</p>
