  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Too easy.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There was a student in India who wanted to know the truth.  He left the family in search of a guru.  Stopping at one of them, he asked about how to achieve enlightenment.  Guru said: <br>  - To achieve enlightenment can be very simple.  All you need is to go back home, and every evening to sit in front of the mirror for half an hour, asking yourself the same question: “Who am I?  Who am i?  Who am i?" <br><br>  The student asked: <br>  “Hey, it can't be that easy.” <br>  “Oh, yes, it’s really simple,” the guru answered, “but if you would like to hear a different opinion, then other gurus live on this street.”  Ask them. <br>  “Thank you very much,” said the student, “I will.” <br><br>  <i>[this behavior is called a third-party opinion search]</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      And the student came to another guru with the same question.  The second guru replied: <br>  - Oh, it is very difficult and will take a lot of time.  You must unite with your like-minded people in the community and work hard and not receive any reward. <br><br>  The apprentice was very excited;  The philosophy of this guru was more compatible with his own view of the path to true enlightenment.  He always heard that it was difficult.  The guru told him that the only unoccupied work in the community was cleaning a cow shed.  If the intention to achieve enlightenment from a student is really serious, then the guru will allow him to clean the manure and keep the shed clean.  The student accepted the offer, feeling confident that he was on the right track. <br><br>  After five long years of manure harvesting and keeping the cow shed clean, the student felt discouraged and began to be impatient about his enlightenment.  He came to the guru and said: <br><br>  - Honorable teacher, I sincerely and faithfully served you for five years, doing the dirtiest work in your community.  I have not missed a single day and never complained.  Do you think that the time has come for me to know the truth? <br><br>  Guru replied: <br>  - Well, yes, it seems to me that you are ready.  Now listen to what you need to do.  Go home and every evening, for half an hour in front of the mirror, ask yourself one question many times: “Who am I?  Who am i?  Who am i?" <br><br>  Astonished student said: <br>  - Forgive me, but confirm again, because five years ago it was exactly this that another guru who lives down this street told me. <br>  “Well, yes, he was right,” remarked the guru. <br>  “So why did I clean cow dung all these five years then?” <br>  “Because you are a fool,” the guru answered. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/45463/</p>
