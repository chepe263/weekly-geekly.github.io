      2. Their success in the market will depend entirely on the price.  For each audience I spoke to, I asked the question ‚ÄúWho would like to buy Google Glass?‚Äù.  When I called the price of $ 200 literally everyone raised their hands.  $ 500 was raised several times less than hands.  It did not depend on who was in the audience, students or more adults. <br><br>  3. Almost everyone expressed his opinion as ‚Äúwow‚Äù, ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù. <br><br>  4. On NextWeb, 50 people surrounded me and said that they would not let me go anywhere until I let everyone try. <br><br>  5. I was quite surprised by the amount of backlash against Google Glass.  Only one person asked me to take them off, saying that "he won't say this thing on me for the time being."  Someone asked me to go to their bathroom. <br><br>  6. I discovered a huge generation gap.  Adults treated Google Glass cooler and more skeptical than 13-21 year olds. <br><br>  So let's talk about the price.  I bet that Larry Page is considering two pricing policies: something around $ 500, which should be pretty profitable, or $ 200, which is enough only to cover the cost of production.  If you disassemble the glasses, you will see that there are not so many expensive parts.  They were designed for mass production.  In other words, millions of google glass.  The only way for Google to massively introduce this device is about $ 300. <br><br>  I would not be surprised if Larry chooses an aggressive pricing policy and they will be sold for $ 200.  Why does Google do this? <br><br>  It's simple: I'm already very attached to Google services.  My photos and videos are automatically uploaded to Google+.  Soon it will be possible to add other services (I just received an application for Twitter photos from a third-party developer), but automatic loading of images to other services very quickly "kills" the battery in both the phone and glasses.  Therefore, I will think three times before adding Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Evernote to my glasses.  Especially when Google+ works damn well out of the box. <br><br>  Also, Google has banned advertising in applications.  This is a huge step for the business model of this company.  Perhaps Larry wants to transfer the main income from the advertising sector to the commercial one. <br><br>  After two weeks of wearing these glasses, you realize that you have great opportunities.  They give you a whole world of shopping and entertainment. <br><br>  1. Points are much more social than a smartphone.  Why?  I don‚Äôt need to look away from my interlocutor to search Google or get directions. <br><br>  2. Voice control works, and works in almost every situation.  This is the first product that almost everyone can control their voice. <br>  This is really amazing, even though I know that there is no magic in this and the glasses can react only to a few specified commands.  OK Glass, Take a Picture works, and OK Glass, Take a Photo does not.  By sacrificing some variety of phrases, tremendous recognition accuracy is achieved, even if you speak with a strong accent. <br><br>  I do not cease to be surprised by the camera.  This is a completely new experience from photos and videos.  Why?  I can "catch" moments.  I figured out how many seconds it takes to get a smartphone out of my pocket, open the camera application on it, wait until it loads and take a photo.  Six to 12 seconds.  With Google Glass - less than a second.  Everytime. <br><br>  This is the most interesting novelty since the release of the iPhone. <br>  Yes, of course, we can say that the camera does not shoot well enough in the dark, that there are few applications.  What the device looks like is strange. <br>  But I do not care.  Google Glass changed my life.  I will not live a day without them. <br><br>  This is simply amazing. <br>  Larry, find a way to sell them for $ 200 and you will have a product that will blow up the market. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/178363/</p>
