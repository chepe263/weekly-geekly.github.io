  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The fight against laziness or the problem of delayed promotion.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of you have probably been confronted with the situation - there is an important, interesting, profitable business (it‚Äôs necessary to underline;), there is time to do this.  And the soul does not lie to him.  One has only to get to work, as if the devil is twitching to listen to music, surf the Internet, chat with friends.  One - another time, not all right, but it happens all the time, and often under the most plausible pretexts (for example: in order to learn new information necessary for the project).  Nothing but the machinations of the unclean. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Congratulations, you are faced with a problem of delayed promotion.  Those.  it is not the devilry to blame, and it is senseless to call an exorcist, but your psyche.  This problem has long been studied by psychologists, a solution has been found and you just have to use it. <br>  We are nothing more than animals.  Reasonable social animals.  And the basic properties of our psyche are 90% the same - conditioned reflexes.  Consciousness is a younger part of the psyche, and often not having the right to vote, not making decisions. <br>  So, about animals.  Chicken can be taught pecking key for a grain of wheat.  Moreover, it can be taught to peck a key several times.  So, the longer the gap between the start of work and the promotion, the more reluctant the chicken is to peck at it and the more pauses (especially at the beginning) between shocks.  True like our case. <br>  How it is treated. <br>  Develop a clear self-help system. <br>  1. Determine what is positive reinforcement for you - i.e.  What can motivate you to work.  It does not have to be something complicated (sometimes it is a reward to rest with a sense of accomplishment.) <br>  2. Break the work into clear and achievable stages and support (give yourself encouragement) to complete each stage. <br>  3.If you have unexpectedly completed a task (for example, you have invented a more efficient implementation of the algorithm), be sure to encourage yourself.  Even if the time for submitting reinforcements did not fit.  You must consolidate your successes. <br>  4. In time, if you do everything correctly, the need for artificial reinforcement should disappear.  The body produces a stable link between work and final reward.  So similar problems are characteristic only for beginners. <br>  And further.  Remember the law of conservation of energy - Never delay for tomorrow what you can not do at all.  Laziness is the same achievement of evolution as consciousness.  So weigh the pros and cons and forward. <br><br>  I learned this decision from <br>  Karen Pryor.  Do not growl at the dog!  <a href="http://www.libbooks.ru/bookbox_93046.html">www.libbooks.ru/bookbox_93046.html</a> <br>  [Long-term behavior programs] <br>  I recommend to read to all.  There is a very clear and easy language of presentation.  + lots of useful practical examples. <br><br>  Inspired me to write an article <br>  Learn to Work ‚Üí How I Fought with Time <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/44532/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/44532</a> <br>  Here is a private solution to the problem.  Having the charm of a freshly invented bicycle.

      In general, good luck to all.  I hope it helped. <br>  Threat After a day ... The article was not about how to motivate yourself, but about how useful it is to read classic working solutions before reinventing the wheel. <br>  All around  Including with self-motivation. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/45813/</p>
