The secret of the effectiveness of this method lies in combining the benefits of display advertising with elements of PR. <a name="habracut"></a>  In addition, the natural and unobtrusive way of attracting an audience inherent in native advertising does not cause negative emotions and the phenomenon of “banner blindness.”  Promoted articles for native advertising campaigns always correspond to the theme of the site used, therefore they are well perceived by the audience. <br><br>  Native 360 ​​presenters Andrei Kuzeev and Veronika Filonenko invited the director of the Goldfish Media advertising agency Andrei Molchanov to broadcast on Mediametrics radio.  The presenters and their guest talked about the situation that has developed in the advertising market, voiced obsolete and replacing technologies in the field of Internet promotion, revealed the interaction of advertising agencies with pharmaceutical companies.

The unstable economic situation that has replaced the “obese” years has taught advertisers to use campaigns not for statistics, but for real results.  Now advertisers want every ruble invested in advertising to be worked out and not spent on a “beautiful” report of an advertising agency. <br><br>  At present, both conventional and innovative promotion techniques are being used.  For example, banner advertising is an expensive way to increase brand awareness, and it can have enormous impression statistics.  Therefore, the leaders who used to think and act traditionally, yesterday were able to put a multi-million dollar budget for creativity and the display of a banner located “in the head” of the main page of the prestigious site.  At the same time, such a manager, like the project performer, usually omitted the facts of the presence of the so-called “banner blindness” and the fact that impressive statistics were achieved in a few hours, after which the banner stopped working. <br><br>  The time that has come can be considered the era of native advertising because the publication naturally interwoven into the theme of the site not only does not cause the reader rejection or “banner blindness”, but also turns out to be necessary and relevant, since the user himself always becomes the initiator of downloading sponsored content.  Conversion counters are placed on the number of downloads, and since only interested users click on the links, it is safe to say that the article has been read and the integrated recommendation has been learned.  Therefore, advertisers who are interested in getting a result, rather than an impressive report on the campaign, are currently preferring native advertising. <br><br><h2>  Brand awareness or increased sales? </h2><br>  Advertising banner can at least go unnoticed or cause irritation to the user, as a maximum - to increase brand awareness.  A text block with integrated brand mentioning is timely placed exactly where potential buyers will be looking for it.  Content naturally flowing into the theme of the site helps the ready-to-make purchase, but for a doubtful user, to make a choice in favor of a promoted drug that will help solve the current problem.  The user making the decision will have to “vote with the wallet” - to make a purchase.  That purchase is an action that confirms the effectiveness of native advertising as a sales tool. </div><p>Source: https://habr.com/ru/post/300290/</p>
